1. Calculate the simple interest on Rs. 8000 for 15 months at 6 paise per rupee per month.

Solution:
Given,

Principal amount (P) = Rs. 8000

Time (T) = 15 months

Rate (R) = 6 paise per rupee per month

Here, the rate of interest and the time are given per month.

So, we can use the simple interest formula as:

SI = PTR/100

= (Rs. 8000 × 15 × 6)/100

= Rs. 7200

Therefore, the simple interest is Rs. 7200.
